# Understanding Code from GitHub Repository
* Designed by Joseph Craig *

## Introduction
In this document, we'll walk through the process of obtaining code from a GitHub repository, understanding its structure, and comprehending its functionality.

## Step 1: Cloning the Repository
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository containing the code.
2. Click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine.

## Step 2: Exploring the File Structure
Once the repository is cloned, explore its file structure to gain an understanding of how the code is organized.
- Look for main directories such as `src`, `docs`, `tests`, etc.
- Identify configuration files like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `setup.py`.
- Pay attention to any README files or documentation provided in the repository.

## Step 3: Understanding the Code
1. Start by examining the main files in the repository.
2. Look for entry points such as `index.js`, `main.py`, or similarly named files.
3. Dive into individual files to understand their purpose and functionality.
4. Identify key components, functions, or classes, and understand how they interact with each other.
5. Pay attention to comments, documentation strings, or any inline documentation provided within the code.

## Step 4: Running the Code
Depending on the nature of the code, you may need to run it to observe its behavior.
1. Follow any instructions provided in the repository's README or documentation to set up the environment.
2. Use appropriate commands or scripts to run the code.
3. Experiment with different inputs or parameters to understand its behavior under various conditions.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you should have a better understanding of the code obtained from the GitHub repository. Remember to document any insights or observations for future reference.
