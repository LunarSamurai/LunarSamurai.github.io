    <li><strong>Environment Setup:</strong> Set up a controlled environment using Docker. Commands: <code>docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa</code> then <code>docker run -d -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa</code>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a safe, legal environment for SQL injection practice. Docker containers provide a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run DVWA, a vulnerable web application.</p>
        <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. Download from the Docker website and follow the setup instructions. Access DVWA through <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tool Installation:</strong> Install SQLmap and a web proxy. Command: <code>sudo apt-get install sqlmap</code>. Set up a proxy like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Equip your environment with tools for SQL injection testing. SQLmap automates the process of detecting SQL injection flaws.</p>
        <p><strong>Execution:</strong> After installation, configure your browser to route traffic through the proxy by setting the proxy server in your browser's network settings. This setup allows you to capture and manipulate live traffic.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Learning HTTP Basics:</strong> Use the proxy to inspect and modify HTTP requests and responses.
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Understand the foundation of web communications for effective security testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Capture traffic with your proxy tool while interacting with DVWA. Study different HTTP methods like GET and POST, and the roles of headers, cookies, and body data in HTTP requests. Manipulate these to see how server responses change.</p>
